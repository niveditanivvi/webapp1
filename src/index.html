                        Harappan Civilisation is also known as Indus Valley Civilisation. It is the oldest Civilisation of India.
There is no consensus about the chronology of the Harappan Civilisation.
Various scholars have given different dates about this period.
According to Sir John Marshall, “this civilisation flourished between 3250 and 2750 BCE”.
It was Daya Ram Sahni, who first discovered the sites of Harappan in 1921.
The main centres of this civilisation are in Pakistan. The same famous sites of this civilisation (now in Pakistan) are Mohenjodaro and Chanhudaro.
The main centre where this Civilisation flourished in India are Kalibangan, Sangol, Pengplor, Lothal, Dholavira and Banawali.
The urban planning of this civilisation was very magnificent. The houses were built in a systematic manner. Roads were wide and cut each other at right angle.
The people of Indus Valley Civilisation had also made best planning for the drainage of rainwater and dirty water.
The caste system was not present in the society. All the people lived together with mutual love and understanding.% The women held a high position or rank in the society.
They were fond of fashion. The economic life the people was very prosperous.
The main occupations of the people were the agriculture and domestication of animals.
Trade was well developed. Both maternal and external trade was carried out.
The people worshipped many gods and goddesses. They worshipped mother goddesses, Lord Shiva, animal, birds, trees and the Sun.
They knew arts and crafts. They knew the art of making beautiful sculptures, toys, pottery, ornaments, etc. They were skilled in the production of seals.
The languages used by them on the seals is still to be deciphered. If one is able to decipher their script inscribed on the seals, it will throw a flood of the light on the various aspects of the Harappan Civilisation.
The main sources of our information of Harappan Civilisation is archaeological materials. The excavation carried out at Indus sites tries to reconstruct the history of this civilisation.
During the excavation of Indus sites, many tools, pottery, seals, household objects, etc. have excavated.
All these excavated materials are deeply examined by the archaeologists.
Many historians like Cunningham, R.E.M. Wheeler, John Marshall and G.F.
Dates have played a valuable role in reconstructing the history of the ancient past including the Indus Valley Civilisation sites.
Many Indian archaeologists like Daya Ram Sahni, S.R. Rao, R.S. Bisht and B.K. Thapar have played a great role in excavations of the Indus sites.
Indus Valley Civilisation is also known as Bronze Age Civilisation, because people used bronze extensively for making their pottery, figure lines and ornaments.
